# The Cloud-Borne Keep

*By Targon, Warden of the Ancient Skies*

Beneath the realm where eagles soar,
And lofty winds begin to roar,
In epochs lost, the tale's seed,
A city born from cloud and deed.

## Prelude to Creation

_Whispers stirred the silent ether,_
_A vision sparked by the sky's own breather;_
_Giants of air, with softest tread,_
_Crafted a keep where none would dread._

### The Foundations Laid

With claws of time, and breath of stars,
Targon's might carved spires from Mars.
Each stone set with purpose and care,
A citadel in the heavens fair.

#### Walls of Vapor

**Walls woven from the morning mist,**
**Held aloft by magic's wrist,**
**Bound by spells so ancient and pure,**
**A sanctuary, safe and sure.**

##### Towers Ascending

- Spiraled high, the towers gleam,
- Kissed by sunlight's softest beam,
- Watchful eyes in skyward gaze,
- Through the haze of endless days.

###### The Heart

`In the core, a dragon's heart,`
`Beat for the city, a vital part.`
`Targon's fire, his endless balm,`
`Gave life and light, a soothing calm.`

####### The Inhabitants Arrive

Inhabitants from lands afar,
Drawn to the city like a guiding star.
Targon watched with gleaming eye,
As they found a home in the sky.

######## Conclusion

And so the cloud city stands, serene,
A testament to what has been.
Targon's tale, from ages deep,
Holds the city in enchanted sleep.
